# properties for organization mapping

## enable extended mapping as configured below (as opposed to 1:1 mapping)
## defaults to false
enable.custom.mapping=false

## if true, the org mapping keys must match the beginning of department name.
## otherwise, org mapping keys must match the complete department name
## when multiple prefixes match the user's department, the longest match wins
## defaults to false
match.prefix=false

## mappings from LDAP department to organization name
## mappings are stored in the following form:
##
## mapping.some.ldap.department=SOME LDAP DEPT SOURCE
## mapping.some.ldap.department.target=DEPT TARGET
##
## The prefix "mapping." is mandatory.
## ".target" is appended to every key to find the mapped organization name
